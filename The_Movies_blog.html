                         he is too nice for his own good and is a pushover when it comes to confrontations.

                         However, a small time crime boss, Dorian Tyrel (Peter Greene), comes across this character dubbed 'The Mask' by the media.
                         After Ipkiss's alter ego indirectly kills his friend in crime, Tyrel now wants this green-faced goon destroyed.
